# sheets-to-gmail
This tool allows you to enter information into a Google Sheets document and then send a preformatted HTML email using that data.

## Try It Out
1. Open the Google Sheet: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tB_2CaiBqGEDBceOuz2hQpbWQqYwOLDbwM4ua9AFd-4/edit?usp=sharing)
2. Follow the instructions noted on the first tab to send a test email

## Notes
* This was originally designed to send Project and Program email status updates, as you can see from the screenshots. You'll need to update the Google Sheet and Apps Script code to repurpose.
* The Project Files are in .gs format, specific to Google Apps Script: [Google Apps Script Dashboard](https://script.google.com/home)
